# Streamlit based Retirement Planning app (mostly for Indian context)

This is a tool to plan for retirement (or obtain the FIRE amount needed!) and also contains simulators to play around with various scenarios.



Although, there are several retiremnt planners available, most of them are not tailored for Indian context.

Few points to be considered:

a) Extensively used rule such as by Bill Bengen's 4% rule [1] (from which FIRE amount is calculated as '25x of Annual Expenses') is not suited for Indian context. 

b) Eventhough few Indian studies propose 3% rule [2](and thereby propose 33 x Annual expenses to be apt amount for FIRE), it is still fraught with assumptions that many are not commonly aware of.

c) This tool helps in arriving at the retirement amount considering inflation before as well as after retirement as well as several other factors.
This is based on the retirement planner by Prof. Pattu from FreeFincal  

d) There are also simulators which you can play around with for considering multiple scenarios for planning (Bucket Strategy Simulator [4])
